  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This week saw the release of the 2016 Census of Agriculture data. It provided an opportunity to check up on the use of trees on British Columbia (BC) farms for production and conservation. Unfortunately, there are no statistics gathered to help us determine what management systems are employed. Hence, the numbers presented here represent the use of trees in a blend of conventional horticulture, farm forestry and agroforestry.</p>

<p>All raw data has been derived from the Statistics Canada’s Census of Agriculture for 2011 and 2016. Tables 004-0200, 004-0208, 004-0214, 004-0218, 004-0219 and 004-0220 are used.</p>

<h3 id="tree-fruit-and-nut-production-increases">Tree Fruit and Nut Production Increases</h3>

<p>When classed by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), 3,180 farms representing 18.1% of all BC farms were categorized as fruit or tree nut farms. This is up from 17.0% in 2011, and well ahead of the national proportion of 4.1%. These numbers however, include a significant number of berry producers (blueberry, raspberry) concentrated in the Lower Mainland region. In specific tree fruit categories, BC has 3,921 ha of apples (0.4% increase from 2011), 259 ha of pears (0.4% decrease from 2011), 191 ha of plums (1.1% increase from 2011), 1,987 ha of sweet cherries (17.5% increase from 2011), 42 ha of sour cherries (5.0% increase from 2011), 522 ha of peaches (2.2% increase from 2011) and 98 ha of apricots (a decrease of 4.3% from 2011). These plantings represent 22, 29, 29, 91, 4, 20 and 66%, respectively, of the national totals for these tree fruits.</p>

<p>Tree fruit production is highly concentrated within the Okanagan Valley. The Okanagan-Similkameen and Central Okanagan Regional Districts account for approximately one-third of the provincial tree fruit and nut farms. And this is 79% of the total area in BC planted.</p>

<p>Domestic markets are important for fruit and nut sales, but export markets are on the rise. The large expansion in cherry plantings can be almost wholly attributed to BC sweet cherry exports to China. Exports are creating much stronger demand for these high quality soft fruits.</p>

<h3 id="big-increases-in-forest-products-sales">Big Increases in Forest Products Sales</h3>

<p>Forest product sales from BC farms rose 40.1% from 2011 to over $6.3 million. This represents about 9% of the total sales of forest products from farmland across Canada. The large increase in raw log sales from farms reflect, in part, shrinking supplies from Crown lands. This is due, in part, to where the mountain pine beetle has run its course and salvage harvest volumes are declining. Overall however, wood sales from farms in BC remains a very small proportion of the total harvest. And sales from farmland have not yet rebounded to pre-pine beetle levels.</p>

<h3 id="non-timber-forest-production-declining">Non-timber Forest Production Declining</h3>

<p>Production of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) on BC farms has weakened since 2011. The total number of farms growing Christmas trees has declined by 21%, and the area planted by 23%. Total farm area dedicated to Christmas trees now sits at 2,016 ha. But importantly, from a total industry standpoint, this does not include the areas of public lands used for Christmas tree harvest.</p>

<p>BC’s burgeoning bigleaf maple tapping sector gave mixed signals on it’s growth. The number of farms reporting maple taps decreased by 7% from 82 to 76 farms, concentrated heavily on Vancouver Island. A portion of this decline may however be attributed to errors in prior reporting.</p>

<p>Some interior farms may have included taps on paper birch trees as maple taps in statistics prior to 2016. Birch tapping data are not collected by Statistics Canada. Encouragingly, though the number of farms reporting taps declined, the number of spiles employed increased by 11% to 4009. The number of maple spiles in BC only accounts for a fraction of the Canadian total (dominated in Quebec and Ontario). Bigleaf maple syrup insiders also note the number of small-scale producers tapping for their own consumption. This is not captured in the Census, and is likely in the hundreds on the Island.</p>

<h3 id="trees-for-conservation-expands">Trees for Conservation Expands</h3>

<p>The use of shelterbelts and windbreaks on BC farms (both natural and planted) continues to increase. Over 27% of BC farms employed shelterbelts in 2016. This is a relative increase of 40% in use of this conservation / agroforestry practice from 2011. BC still lags the national average with 36.4% of all Canadian farms using shelterbelts or windbreaks. BC Peace River regional farms have significantly higher use of shelterbelts. Approximately 58% of farms in the Peace River and Northern Rockies Regional Districts reporting this practice.</p>

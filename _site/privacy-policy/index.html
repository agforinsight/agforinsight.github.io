<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>

<h4 id="who-we-share-your-data-with">Who we share your data with</h4>

<h3 id="data-retention">Data Retention</h3>

<p>For users (if any) that register on this website, any personal information they provide in their user profile will also be stored. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>

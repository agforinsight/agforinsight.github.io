It was my pleasure to facilitate the now defunct BC Agroforestry Industry Development Initiative from 2004 to 2013. The Initiative was also known as the ‘BC Agroforestry Initiative’, or simply ‘Agroforestry BC’ .

Until last month an archive of the projects completed under the Initiative were hosted on www.agroforestry.info. In a move of pure frugality I have shifted hosting to [Google’s Blogger platform](http://agroforestry-update.blogspot.ca/).

Here’s to keepin’ the agroforestry revolution alive in BC.

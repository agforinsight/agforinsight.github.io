### Water Conservation

Adapting to a changing climate will be one of the key factors to the future success of agriculture. Water conservation in farm settings should start with building the capacity of the land to capture and retain precipitation. Agroforestry methods have been proven as effective tools for water management. Enhancing water capture and storage in the soil can be a cost-effective solution to minimizing drought impacts in dryland farming.

This video presentation was the second of three that I made to the 2020 *Water Management Strategies for Dryland Agriculture Webinar Series*. The webinar series was sponsored by the BC Agriculture and Food Climate Action Initiative. And, was delivered as part of their regional adaptation program.

### Agroforestry Traps and Holds Water

This lecture, in two parts, provides an introduction to agroforestry and highlights the importance of intention in blending trees and shrubs with agriculture. I also describe some key influences agroforestry has on slowing the water cycle. Please have a look at my [introductory presentation on agriculture and water cycle](https://agforinsight.com/agriculture-and-the-water-cycle), for more background on these concepts.

This video provides some practical management guidance on using agroforestry for water conservation. And it includes discussion on establishing and managing shelterbelts, hedgerows, silvopastures and riparian buffers.
